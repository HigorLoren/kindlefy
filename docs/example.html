        <p>
          I was recently tasked to log a variety of window events within a modal that held an iframe
          widget. Most of these were a simple POST request containing messages provided by the third
          party iframe source.
        </p>
        <p>
          This presented a separate issue of permissions between sources. I was unable to navigate
          to the parent node of the iframe because the origin sources were different. This led me to
          eventually finding the <code>sendBeacon()</code> method!
        </p>

        <div class="separator" role="separator">
          <span></span>
          <span></span>
          <span></span>
        </div>

        <p>
          A method from the Beacon API, it allows you to send a POST request with two parameters —
          the URL endpoint for the request as well as the data being passed.
          <code>sendBeacon</code> is particularly useful if you want to send a small amount of data
          and do not particularly care about a response.
        </p>
        <pre><code>navigator.sendBeacon(url, data);</code></pre>
        <p>
          One of — if not <i>the</i> — main use for <code>sendBeacon</code> is to solve the issue of
          asynchronous requests being cancelled by the browser. In my example, I wanted to send a
          message to a database that would log when the modal window closed. Using a
          <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>, the modal would close too quickly and the POST request did
          not have the time to fire off.
        </p>
        <p>
          With more and more browsers deprecating or removing support for synchronous events due to
          the impact on the user experience I wanted to look for a solution that would not block the
          UI thread.
        </p>

        <pre><code>window.addEventListener("unload", function() {
  var event_type = "window_closed";
  var base = document.getElementById('iframe-div');
  var uuid_data = base.getAttribute( 'data-uuid');
  var primary_id = base.getAttribute( 'data-primary-id');

  var formData = new FormData();
  FormData.append("uuid_data", uuid_data);
  FormData.append("event_type", event_type);
  FormData.append("primary_id", primary_id);

  navigator.sendBeacon('/endpoint/url', FormData);
});</code></pre>
        <p>
          Above is what ended up being my solution — with some variable name changes for the purpose
          of this post. By using the <code>unload</code> event, the function is fired when the user
          navigates away from the window. So on <code>unload</code>, all the information desired to
          send is gathered into a <code>FormData</code> object and sent as the second argument to
          the URL that will receive the data.
        </p>

        <div class="separator" role="separator">
          <span></span>
          <span></span>
          <span></span>
        </div>

        <p>
          A second argument is not required, you could call <code>sendBeacon</code> without any data
          or with a url containing query params. If you do want to send data, you can send a string,
          <code>FormData</code> object, <code>Blob</code>, or an <code>ArrayBufferView</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The documentation says you can also send <code>URLSearchParams</code>, but I had read a
          few mentions that this can have some issues, so I decided to collect my data into a
          <code>FormData</code> object.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since <code>sendBeacon</code> does not require a response from the server, it instead
          returns <code>true</code> if the data was queued for transfer — and if not it returns
          <code>false</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          It’s worth noting that sendBeacon is not supported by IE11 yet, but is supported in pretty
          much everything else.
        </p>

        <div class="separator" role="separator">
          <span></span>
          <span></span>
          <span></span>
        </div>

        <p>
          I wanted to write up this quick post because after implementing it, I thought sendBeacon
          was a pretty cool solution and it does not seem to be very well known. It provides an
          alternative that does not impact the load time of the next page or slow anything down.

          Besides the documentation, I found <a href="https://golb.hplar.ch/2018/09/beacon-api.html"><i>this page</i></a> to include some helpful examples and
          additional information. Thanks for reading!
